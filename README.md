# python-project

this project is for classifying images using the HGAO algorithm to maximize the hyperparameters of dense net

(dense net is a deep learning model) 

the  HGAO is a two-part, bio-inspired metaheuristic search used in place of manual tuning or grid search

we'll be working on 3 main datasets
